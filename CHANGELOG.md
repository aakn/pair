# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and
this project versions are for now mere release numbers. They don't have any particular meaning.

We might adopt some kind of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
in the future, but we're still thinking about what that would mean for an API like Aura.

## 0.1.0 - 2018-08-16

### Added

- Proof of concept implementation of `pair`

> **CAUTION**: This version does overwrite your global Git commit.template configuration.
