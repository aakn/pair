You love attributing your pairs when [committing together][together]? We all do!

But writing names once an again is repetitive enough that we forget doing it, isn't it?

Not anymore! Start your pairing sessions and switch pairs with a simple üçê command, while keeping control over your commit messages! Ready to get started?

Installation
------------

_To be defined. ([What is going on here?][rdd])_

  [rdd]: http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html

Usage
-----

```bash
pair with "Gonzalo <gonzalo.bulnes@redbubble.com>" # that's all!

# Wanna pair swap?
pair with "Alice <alice@example.com>"

# Never stop pairing!
# Well, if you do:
pair stop
```

That sounds cool, [how does it work?](./doc/README.md)
