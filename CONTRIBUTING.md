# Contributing

I love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its [code of conduct].

[code of conduct]: ./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Fork, then clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/pair.git

As you can see, there is no code yet! Don't let that stop you; give it a go if you feel inspired.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/pair/compare/

At this point you're waiting on me. I like to at least comment on pull requests within a few days (and, typically, one day). If I fail to do so, please send me a note at pairproject@fastmail.com!
Most likely it's been a busy week and I've
missed the Github notification.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Be ready to üçê pair on getting your pull request ready to merge (is that a surprise?)
* Write a [thoughtful commit message][commit].
